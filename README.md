# NL_CL Website

This is the NL_CL (Netherlands Coding Live) community's website. Please feel free to contribute to this website if you have any links/videos/events/workshops to share with the community! ðŸŽ‰ Below are some instructions for contribution and how the site works in general.

## Install

The site is build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). An open-source static-site generator framework. You'll have to install `hugo` and `git` if you want to work on the site locally.

Follow the instructions here: [https://gohugo.io/installation/](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

*Windows user: You'll have to use [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4)*

Check if the installation worked correctly by running: 

`hugo version` (the version should be v0.112.0 or later)

Now clone this repository to your computer: 

`git clone --recursive-submodules https://github.com/netherlands-coding-live/netherlands-coding-live.github.io.git`

To run the server locally and develop for the site:

`hugo server -D`

Then go to: `localhost:1313` to view the website (or the port that is printed in the terminal)

When you are happy with the results you can also built and deploy the site to the `/public` folder:

`hugo`

## Usage

Hugo builds the pages/posts from markdown (`.md`) files. The markdown syntax makes it very easy to add new pages without worrying to much about the actual layout.

The actual layout is described in the `/layout` folder with `.html` files. The html files are generalized and parts of it get replaced based on the content of the markdown files. This is done in the build/deploy stage. So the output is a static site with only html pages. You can find a markdown guide in `http://localhost:1313/events/markdown-guide` or on [this github gist](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d#file-markdown_guide-md).

### Add Event

You can add your upcoming event as a markdown file in the `/events` folder. Create a new file with the name: `yyyy-mm-dd-shortname.md`. You can use a previous event as an example to see how everything is formatted. Please refer to the `/events/markdown-guide.md` to see what you can do with markdown. In the beginning of the file type the following:

```
+++
title = 'Your event title' (keep it short for best view)
date = 'yyyy-mm-dd:hh:mm:ss+00:00' (use the date and start time of the event, add the timezone offset too with +00:00)
publishDate = 'yyyy-mm-dd' (set this to the current date in order for the page to be rendered)
draft = false (set this to true while developing and if you don't want to publish yet)
+++
```

Now you can add the details for your event in the markdown file following this template:

```markdown
<!--Type a summary here-->

A little summary of your event for on the main page.

<!--Don't remover the "more" comment, this is important for rendering the summary on the main page!-->
<!--more-->

### Embed

If you like to embed some item from another webpage, for example a youtube video, you can use the hugo `shortcode`s. The shortcode for a youtube video is: `{{< youtube video-ID >}}`. You can put this in the markdown file and it will generate the necessary html code (using `<iframe>` etc). The markdown will look like this:

```markdown
# The ICLC 2023 Aftermovie

This is the aftermovie from the International Conference on Live Coding 2023 in Utrecht.

{{< youtube IDehg9Wbrws >}}
```

You can find other shortcodes such as `gist`, `vimeo`, `twitter`, `instagram` or read on how to make your own shortcodes in the [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).

### Change Style

You can add additional styling to the `static/css/customstyle.css` file. If you want to use a style that is different between light and dark mode you can put it in the `.darkmode{ }` and `.lightmode{ }` class. If you want a style that can be refered to in multiple places use a variable name `--your-var-name:` in `:root{ }` and refer to the style in the correct places with `var(--your-var-name)`

### Change Layout

You can change the layout by adjust the files in `/layouts`. The `/_default/baseof.html` is the html every page is based on. The `/index.html` is the layout for the main page when you enter the site. The `/partials/footer.html` is the layout for the footer. If you want to adjust a layout of a page that is not there, then you can find it in the `/themes/<theme-name>/layouts`. 

It is good practice to copy the file from the theme to the other `/layouts` folder and then adjust it there. This way your new layout wont get overwritten by an update to the theme.
