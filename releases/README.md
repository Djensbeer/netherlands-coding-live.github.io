# Live Coding Releases List

> A community-driven catalogue of live coding releases

## About

This catalogue was created with the intention to give an overview of musical *(in the broadest sense of the word)* releases from artists in the live coding community that used (live) coding and algorithmic processes in order to generate the sonic output. 

The catalogue includes bandcamp releases only to support exposure and potential income for the artists and hopefully increase their supporters. The list is sorted alphabetically by artist name. If you head over to [this page]() you can find the list in interactive format with bandcamp embeds.
