## About

On Sunday afternoon September 12, Gaudeamus, Creative Coding Utrecht, and NL_CL present ALG0MA5, a concert in which you will see digital creativity enrich the practice of composition, instrument builders and musicians with new possibilities.

Brazilian composer and hardware hacker Rafaele Andrade will showcase the versatility of her hybrid instrument KNURL. KNURL is a 16-string hybrid cello made of durable material and equipped with built-in electronic components. With the additional connectivity opened by the electronics, the audience can influence the music during the concert. Timo Hoogland, Jonathan Reus, Sabrina Verhage and Anne Veinberg & Felipe Ignacio Noriega on the CodeKlavier will give a demonstration of this.

The program is framed with performances by Ivan Paz, Bla≈æ Pavlica and Gaia Leandre, live coders who are part of the European collaborative project On-The-Fly. ALG0MA5 is a Sunday afternoon program where you can experience live coding as a hybrid (analogue/physical/digital) improvisation practice in all its facets.

ALG0MA5 is part of On-The-Fly, a project made possible by the support of Creative Europe, the Performing Arts Fund and the Creative Industries Fund NL.
