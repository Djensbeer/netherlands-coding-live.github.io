## About

This year the international Algorave movement exists for 10 years, and to celebrate NL_CL, CCU & Uncloud team up again five years after our first Algorave in Ekko. This time we take over the former prison at de Gansstraat to create a full immersive experience in which we offer the stage to the growing community of live coders and showcase its diversity of expressions.
