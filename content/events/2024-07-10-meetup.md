## About

This event is an open meetup of the live coding community in Eindhoven. It will also serve as an introduction to live coding, to show some of the different live coding tools avaiable. The event is an informal yet informative open session anyone from the public is very welcome to participate, you do not need to have previous experience in live coding or programming. The idea is to share, learn and get inspired in dialogue. After the presentations we will organise a "From Scratch" session. Where everyone gets a change to start from zero and make a piece of music and or visuals in 9 minutes.

This session is organised by Wilbert Vogel a.k.a. Lil Bleep.
