## About

This event is an open meetup of Rotterdam’s live coding community. Participating artists will show their work environments and creative ideas. The event is an informal yet informative open session anyone from the public is very welcome to participate, you do not need to have previous experience in live coding or software development. The idea is to share, learn and get inspired in dialogue.

The collective is a dynamic group that welcomes anyone with curiosity and a will to participate. This session will be hosted by Rotterdam artists Noemi Biro, Niki Scheijen (Nikilia), Rik Mertens (trem_werk), Bas Ekkelenkamp (333ak), Seb Pappalardo (eerie_ear). We will be showing our audio visual work on a big screen, open for dialogue and hoping to see yours. As is frequent in Netherlands coding live meetups, if time allows we will have a brief “from scratch” jam session. To know more about live coding events in NL please visit their site.
