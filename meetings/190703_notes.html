Meeting July 3th 2019

Attending: Timo, Craig, Felipe, Sebastian, Jonathan, Rafaele, Raphael

A meetup can be hosted in Baltan Laboratories (NATLAB) Eindhoven in the near future. Possibly the next meetup

We'll be hosting a Livecoding Performance and Algorave at Zaal 100 on 11/12 October probably. Trying to at least pay artists for traveling. Tickets can not be > €15.
Hosting a livecoding performance at iii might be optional?
iii performance space: https://instrumentinventors.org/workspace/facilities/

Algorave at the Skatepark can be hosted around october as well.

Add one portfolio link to this site (that link can be embedded on the site):

## We are looking at options for funding livecoding events:

_The Amsterdam Funds voor de Kunst_ has an option for supporting a series in Amsterdam at a specific location: https://www.amsterdamsfondsvoordekunst.nl/

_Fonds voor de Podiumkunst_ has the "SKIP" subsidy to support intermittent programming (a series of minimum 6 shows) - Category 1 has minimal barriers to entry with a max of €5775, must be at a single location:  https://fondspodiumkunsten.nl/nl/subsidies/programmeringsregeling_voor_podia_en_festivals/kleinschalige_en_incidentele_programmering_skip/

__DEADLINE SEPT 18__

Possible venues we can collaborate with:
    * iii space in The Hague (through Marije & Jonathan)
    * V2 in Rotterdam
    * Zaal100 in Amsterdam


## What can we do to plant seeds for a national community while still sustaining our local groups?
>> Craig notes that if every "national" meeting is in a different location then there is no motivation for local groups to self-organize
>> let's alternate between local & national meetings, maybe at the beginning we need to travel with national meetings more often to plant the seeds of local groups, but eventually try to aim for 2-4 national meetings per year

She is running out of money to pay for progress of her work -> she has a crowdfunding campaign
